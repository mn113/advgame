parallax backgrounds
implement y-scaling (per-walkbox value?)
vertical walk speed < horizontal walk speed (depending on perspective)
put non-animating sprites on little canvases to allow for 2x upsampling?
resolution changer: 1x, 2x, 3x, 4x (css/js)
rewrite geometry functions to all use {x:0,y:0} point objects

cutscenes using NPC.say() and NPC.walkTo()
dialogues where NPC speaks to you first
restyle all dialogue ui
build a little delay into the dialogues
grammar fixes: capitalisation, articles...

load the extra items by $.getObject each time?
steganographic obfuscation of new items?
should each item have a special code to prevent fake instantiations?
use html template for adding objects to DOM?
